These scripts test the situation where we remove all station overlap between job types.

That is, we separate the 2 Loading and 4 Hem stations that were initially being shared by both
Vinyl and Mesh job types. 

In these scripts, Vinyl types have 1 Loading and 2 Hem, and the Mesh types have the remainder.

Inspection station is also removed and handled further down the line.
