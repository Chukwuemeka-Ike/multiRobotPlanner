# TODO
Holds TODO's especially when I don't yet know the best place the functionalities should be put.

1. Disable edits to done tickets from edit dialogs - doesn't make sense.
2. Prevent adding a ticket with its own ID as a parent.
3. Change all nodes and utils to use machines from ROS parameters instead of constants file.
4. Shutdown behaviors of the scheduler, ticket manager, GUIs, etc.
